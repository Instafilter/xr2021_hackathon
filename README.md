## How to use app
We added an extra step into the user journey. Users need to place the 3D model of the washing machine and then scan it.  We made that step because the current version of the app has content for one washing machine, and without a physical item, it's hard to use the app. With the 3D model, the judge can see how the app works more authentic.
